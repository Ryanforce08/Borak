      <h1>Ryan Radtke</h1>
      <br>
      <p>I'm a hard worker and sort of know what I'm doing. I'm trained in lifeguarding, which covers first aid, CPR, AED, etc. I was chosen to be the software lead just 5 months into joining the school's robotic team. (There are 2 software members, so I kind of had to). I taught myself how to build stuff like desks and PCs. I know how to wire a house, as I was taught when I went to a construction school two summers ago. I also taught myself how to code in HTML and function, which are used to make Minecraft datapacks. I made a period tracker for school as I was not happy with any that I found online and I wanted to challenge myself.</p>
